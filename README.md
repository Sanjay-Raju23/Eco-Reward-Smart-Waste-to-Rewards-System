# Eco Reward – Smart Waste-to-Rewards System

## Overview
Eco Reward is a smart waste management system that integrates IoT devices with cloud-based processing to encourage responsible waste disposal through a reward-based mechanism. The system automatically classifies waste, stores disposal data in the cloud, and incentivizes users to promote sustainable environmental practices.

## Problem Statement
Traditional waste management systems lack automation and user engagement, resulting in poor waste segregation and inefficient recycling processes.

## Solution
An IoT-enabled smart bin system combined with cloud services that classifies waste, tracks disposal activity, and rewards users digitally to promote sustainable behavior.

## Architecture
- Smart bin equipped with ESP32 / ESP32-CAM
- Sensors and camera module for waste detection and classification
- Cloud backend for data processing and storage
- Reward management and user tracking system

## Workflow
1. Waste is deposited into the smart bin.
2. Sensors and camera modules detect and classify the waste type.
3. Classification data is transmitted to the cloud backend.
4. Cloud services process and store waste data.
5. Users receive rewards for correct waste disposal.

## Technologies Used
- ESP32 / ESP32-CAM
- IoT sensors and camera module
- Cloud backend services
- Python (MicroPython)

## Outcome
- Automated waste classification and monitoring
- Improved waste segregation efficiency
- Increased public participation through incentive-based rewards

## Future Enhancements
- Mobile application integration
- Machine learning-based waste classification
- Analytics dashboard for large-scale waste monitoring
